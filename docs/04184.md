> REST interface is generally more suitable for implementing queries or other operations that do not require transactions. When it comes to data modification, it is often done through events.

*   How to dismantle it? That is, how to correctly understand the business and split the single structure into a service-oriented structure?
*   What if the business has changed and increased after the dismantling? That is, under the premise that business needs are constantly developing and changing, how can it evolve continuously and rapidly?
*   How to dismantle it safely and continuously? That is, how to continuously and safely evolve without affecting the current running state of the system?
*   How to ensure that it is dismantled correctly?
*   How can I guarantee that it won't be damaged after dismantling?

[Command to query the Separation of Duties (CQRS) mode](http://www.cnblogs.com/yangecnu/p/Introduction-CQRS.html)

> If you are confused and troubled by the problems caused by CRUD mode, I recommend you to read this text. Of course, this article talks about more than just solving CRUD-related problems.

*   It may be too rough to use the same object entity for database reading and writing. In most cases, for example, when editing, you may only need to update individual fields, but you need to wear the whole object. Some fields actually don't need to be updated. When querying, you may only need individual fields in the presentation layer, but you need to query and return the whole entity object.
*   When using the same entity object to read and write the same data, you may encounter the situation of resource competition, and you often have to deal with the lock problem. When writing data, you need to lock it. When reading data, it is necessary to judge whether dirty reading is allowed. This will increase the logic and complexity of the system, and will have an impact on the growth of system throughput.
*   Synchronous, direct interaction with the database may affect the performance and responsiveness in the case of simultaneous access of large amounts of data, and may lead to performance bottlenecks.
*   Because the same entity object will be used in reading and writing operations, the management of security and permissions will become more complicated.
